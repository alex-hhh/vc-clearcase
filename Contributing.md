The vc-clearcase project uses only google-code facilities for development and is set up so that anyone can comment on the source code, issues and wiki pages.

See also http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews for how to add comments to the source code.

# If you found a bug or request a feature #

Please use the issue tracker to
[raise an issue](http://code.google.com/p/vc-clearcase/issues/entry).  You can also use the code review facility to point out problems directly in the source code.

# Submitting patches #

If you have a patch with a bug fix or a new feature, please raise an issue and attach the patch to it.  You can use `hg diff` to generate a patch against a mercurial repository clone.  See also SourceCodeNotes for some notes about the Mercurial repository.

If the changes are significant, you might want to create a server-side clone
of the repository and push your changes there.  They will be pulled into the
main repository after they are discussed and reviewed.

# Requesting help #

The project has currently no support mailing list and it is only documented in a few wiki pages.  If you have a question about using vc-clearcase, perhaps the best place is to add a comment to the UsageNotes page.
