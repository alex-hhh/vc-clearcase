* Release 1.115

** ability to set and query the current UCM activity
   This is implemented in `vc-clearcase-set-activity' (also bound to C-x v k)
   and `vc-clearcase-show-current-activity'

** Fix Bug 1741439 vc-clearcase-diff will incorectly use {vc-}diff-switches
** Fix Bug 1740843 Uncheckout may corrupt the ClearCase status of a file
** Fix Bug 1740839 Handling HIJACKED files in UCM views can fail

* Release 1.106

** HIJACKED files are now handled correctly
   On checkout (C-x v v) Emacs will ask whether to keep the changes in the
   HIJACKED file or discard them.  The vc.el terminology for this is 'stealing
   the lock', the question Emacs asks is "Claim lock retaining changes? ".

   See the doc string of `vc-clearcase-steal-lock' for more details.

** you can now cancel the last check-in
   using the "C-x v c" `vc-cancel-version'.

   The last checked in version of a file will be removed and the file checked
   out.  Emacs will ask you whether to discard the actual changes or put them
   in the checked out file.

   See the doc string for `vc-clearcase-cancel-version' for more details.

** `ah-clearcase-diff-format' variable removed
   It is replaced by `vc-clearcase-diff-switches'.  See the doc string of that
   variable.

** preliminary support for UCM
   When a file is in a UCM view, the following will be changed from normal
   ClearCase behaviour:

*** the stream name is displayed in the modeline
*** `vc-clearcase-what-view-tag' will display the UCM activity and stream
*** `vc-clearcase-print-log' will also display activity names for each version

* Release 1.95

** some configuration variables have been renamed.
   If you had non default values for these, you will need to update
   your emacs initialisation file.  The easiest way is to browse the
   vc-clearcase customisation group to set them again.

   `ah-clearcase-checkout-comment-type' was renamed from
   `vc-clearcase-checkout-comment-type'

   `ah-clearcase-checkout-policy' was renamed from
   `vc-clearcase-checkout-policy'

** `vc-clearcase-label-diff-report' creates clickable links in the report
   This only works in Emacs 22, as it requires the button library.

** Fix Bug 1564792 "Process cleartool not running" error
** Fix Bug 1608947 member* unbound error
** Fix Bug 1608952 Username truncated in vc-annotate

* Release 1.87

** instalation instructions have been updated 

   There are now with separate Emacs-Lisp forms for Emacs21 and
   Emacs22

** Two new variables control how a checkout is performed

   vc-clearcase-checkout-policy and
   vc-clearcase-checkout-comment-type.  For more details, see their
   docstrings or browse the vc-clearcase customisation group.

* Release 1.82

The main improvement in this release is the ability to complete label
names for vc-create-snapshot and vc-clearcase-label-diff-report.  A
new vc-clearcase-start-view function is provided (bound to C-x v f),
plus some other minor updates.  See ChangeLog for more details.

* Release 1.69

This is the first public release of vc-clearcase.el.  I have used it
privately for more than a year without any problems.  This version
works with GNU Emacs 21 and the current CVS version.  It has been
tested with Clearcase on Windows XP and Solaris.  See the
documentation section in vc-clearcase.el for installation
instructions.

HINT: The version number is 1.69 because this is the version of the
vc-clearcase.el in CVS.
