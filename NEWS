* Release 3.6

** revision completion is available for VC commands that prompt for revisions
   The revision table is not read until TAB is pressed, as there is a small
   delay for reading it.
** new function `ucm-delete-activity' for deleting UCM activities
   you can only delete an activity if it is not locked and has no revisions
   associated with it.
** Fix problem with checking out files under Emacs 23.3 (Bug #11)
** Faster diffs when an external diff program is used
   (`clearcase-use-external-diff` is t).  vc-clearcase will no longer load
   different file revisions in Emacs before diff-ing them.
** Various compatibility fixes for Emacs 23.3, see ChangeLog for more details.

* Release 3.5

** recognize missing and "special selection" files
** the view tag and vob tag are displayed in *vc-dir* listings
** the version tree browser can be started form a *vc-dir* buffer
** more robust indentification of VOB tags
   for ClearCase installations where the VOBs are not in the default directory
** various small bug-fixes, see ChangeLog for more details

* Release 3.4

This is a bugfix release, containing the following fixes:

** Clearcase 7 compatibility on Windows (Bug #3)
** Create versioned backups for long paths and versions (Bug #4)
** Better compatibility with Emacs vc when setting up diff buffers
** When hijacking a file, it is now made writable on disk
** Ability to remove a file which has checkouts in other branches
** Re-wrote annotation display code to support a flexible date format

* Release 3.3

** Support for GNU Emacs 23.2 vc features:
*** print-log will print only a limited number of log entries
*** displaying a single log entry is faster
    this is used by vc-annotate to show the log revision of the current line
*** multiple files can be registered at once
    you can select multiple unregistered files in a *vc-dir* buffer and
    register them in one go.

** UCM support improvements
*** beter default activity for all commands that prompt for an activity name
*** When checking in files from an activity browser buffer or using `ucm-checkin-activity'
    you can preview the files that will be checked in using "C-c C-f" and view
    the diff using "C-c C-d".  This functionality is provided by
    `log-edit-mode', the vc-clearcase backend provides the necessary
    information.

** various minor bugfixes

* Release 3.2

** Fix Bug #2821317 (ocasional hand while waiting for cleartool output)
** Extra annotate commands
   Three new commands are added to the annotate-mode menu, these are used to
   annotate revisions that were merged into a revision.  The commands are:
   `vc-clearcase-annotate-contributor',
   `vc-clearcase-annotate-contributor-to-line',
   `vc-clearcase-annotate-latest-on-branch'
** Other minor fixes

* Release 3.1

** Fix Bug 2493759 (error when checking out files)
** Other minor fixes 

* Release 3.0
  NOTE: this release was not tested properly, as I don't use Emacs 23 yet.

** new command `ucm-list-activities'

** a new activity browser implementation

** updates for Emacs 23

* Release 1.152

** renaming files works when the destination is in a different VOB

** ucm-checkin-activity will undo checkout on unchanged files
   This allows the checkin to succeed when there are unchanged files
   (ClearCase will not checkin a file with no changes)

** The lshistory (print-log) format has changed to resemble the CVS format
   A new customization variable `clearcase-print-log-show-labels' controls
   whether labels are shown in the `print-log' buffer.

** added functions for checkout/checkin a directory
   see `vc-clearcase-checkout-directory' and `vc-clearcase-checkin-directory',
   they are also present in the menu-bar

** hijacked files can be reverted (C-x v u, `vc-clearcase-revert')
   diffing (C-x v =) also works on them.

** vc-clearcase will now register the parent directory when registering a file
   When registering a file and its directory is not registered with ClearCase,
   vc-clearcase will now register its directory (and any of its parents).
   
   This also works when a file is renamed (`vc-rename-file') to a directory
   which is not registered with ClearCase, however the directory has to be
   inside a ClearCase view.

   This makes directory handling completely transparent for the user.

** better handling of files that cannot be checked out 
   these are files which have a configspec rule with "-nocheckout" in it.
   Trying to checkout such a file will result in an error message from
   vc-clearcase instead of a cleartool error.

** various minor bugfixes.

* Release 1.139

** `vc-clearcase-diff' now works for directory diffs
   even when `clearcase-use-external-diff' is t.  This is usefull for browsing
   activities that contain changes to directories.

** M-- M-x ucm-browse-activity accepts any activity
   not just activities in the current stream.  Activity name completion is not
   available.

** The version control modeline can be customized
   `clearcase-wash-mode-line-function' can be set to a function which can
   process a modeline string.  This can be used to abbreviate long branch and
   UCM stream names.

** `vc-clearcase-cancel-version' -- fix Bug 1849139

** keep contrib and versioned backup files are corectly handled
   For example when opening a file named "foo.c.keep.1", Emacs will corectly
   recognize it as a C file.

* Release 1.136

A few bugfixes to 1.132.  See the ChangeLog for details.

* Release 1.132

** The prefix "ah-" was removed from all functions and variables.
   Aliases were declared for the old variales that can be customized.

** Support for ClearCase UCM now in ucm.el
   The following commands are available (see their doc string for details):

*** ucm-set-activity
*** ucm-show-current-activity
*** ucm-browse-activity
*** ucm-checkin-activity

** Vc-Dired (C-x v d) now works for ClearCase
   It is still slow in a large source tree, and still considered beta
   functionality

** The diff package can now be used for comparing revisions
   It can be enabled using the `clearcase-use-external-diff' variable.  Note
   that this requires a diff program to be installed on the system.

** The format of the print log command has changed to resemble a CVS log

** Fix Bug 1818879: fail gracefully if cleartool is not present

* Release 1.115

** ability to set and query the current UCM activity
   This is implemented in `vc-clearcase-set-activity' (also bound to C-x v k)
   and `vc-clearcase-show-current-activity'

** Fix Bug 1741439 vc-clearcase-diff will incorectly use {vc-}diff-switches
** Fix Bug 1740843 Uncheckout may corrupt the ClearCase status of a file
** Fix Bug 1740839 Handling HIJACKED files in UCM views can fail

* Release 1.106

** HIJACKED files are now handled correctly
   On checkout (C-x v v) Emacs will ask whether to keep the changes in the
   HIJACKED file or discard them.  The vc.el terminology for this is 'stealing
   the lock', the question Emacs asks is "Claim lock retaining changes? ".

   See the doc string of `vc-clearcase-steal-lock' for more details.

** you can now cancel the last check-in
   using the "C-x v c" `vc-cancel-version'.

   The last checked in version of a file will be removed and the file checked
   out.  Emacs will ask you whether to discard the actual changes or put them
   in the checked out file.

   See the doc string for `vc-clearcase-cancel-version' for more details.

** `ah-clearcase-diff-format' variable removed
   It is replaced by `vc-clearcase-diff-switches'.  See the doc string of that
   variable.

** preliminary support for UCM
   When a file is in a UCM view, the following will be changed from normal
   ClearCase behaviour:

*** the stream name is displayed in the modeline
*** `vc-clearcase-what-view-tag' will display the UCM activity and stream
*** `vc-clearcase-print-log' will also display activity names for each version

* Release 1.95

** some configuration variables have been renamed.
   If you had non default values for these, you will need to update
   your emacs initialisation file.  The easiest way is to browse the
   vc-clearcase customisation group to set them again.

   `ah-clearcase-checkout-comment-type' was renamed from
   `vc-clearcase-checkout-comment-type'

   `ah-clearcase-checkout-policy' was renamed from
   `vc-clearcase-checkout-policy'

** `vc-clearcase-label-diff-report' creates clickable links in the report
   This only works in Emacs 22, as it requires the button library.

** Fix Bug 1564792 "Process cleartool not running" error
** Fix Bug 1608947 member* unbound error
** Fix Bug 1608952 Username truncated in vc-annotate

* Release 1.87

** instalation instructions have been updated 

   There are now with separate Emacs-Lisp forms for Emacs21 and
   Emacs22

** Two new variables control how a checkout is performed

   vc-clearcase-checkout-policy and
   vc-clearcase-checkout-comment-type.  For more details, see their
   docstrings or browse the vc-clearcase customisation group.

* Release 1.82

The main improvement in this release is the ability to complete label
names for vc-create-snapshot and vc-clearcase-label-diff-report.  A
new vc-clearcase-start-view function is provided (bound to C-x v f),
plus some other minor updates.  See ChangeLog for more details.

* Release 1.69

This is the first public release of vc-clearcase.el.  I have used it
privately for more than a year without any problems.  This version
works with GNU Emacs 21 and the current CVS version.  It has been
tested with Clearcase on Windows XP and Solaris.  See the
documentation section in vc-clearcase.el for installation
instructions.

HINT: The version number is 1.69 because this is the version of the
vc-clearcase.el in CVS.
