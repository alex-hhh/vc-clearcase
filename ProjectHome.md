vc-clearcase.el is a ClearCase integration package that works as a client to the Emacs VC package.  In addition to the standard VC functionality, this package supports ClearCase specific tasks such as updating static views, edit a view's configspec, list checkouts and start the version tree browser GUI on a file.  UCM is also supported.

There are two release series for this package:

  * GNU Emacs 21 and 22 users should use the 2.x releases
  * GNU Emacs 23 and later users should use the 3.x releases

See UsageNotes for a few notes about using `vc-clearcase` and [Customization](Customization.md) for changing some parameters of the package. If you are using ClearCase UCM, have a look at UcmSupport too.
