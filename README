vc-clearcase.el is a ClearCase integration package that works as a client to
the Emacs VC package. In addition to the standard VC functionality, this
package supports ClearCase specific tasks such as updating static views, edit
a view's configspec, list checkouts and start the version tree browser GUI on
a file. UCM is also supported.

NOTE: this version will not work with Emacs releases prior to version 23.

To install the package, follow these steps:

   1/ Copy this directory under the site-lisp directory of your GNU/Emacs
      installation

   2/ Byte compile vc-clearcase.el and ucm.el.  You can do it from inside
      Emacs, or from the command line:

      % emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile vc-clearcase.el
      % emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ucm.el

   3/ Add the following line to your initialization file (~/.emacs.el):

      (load "vc-clearcase-auto")

The ClearCase backend should activate when you open a file inside a ClearCase
view.
