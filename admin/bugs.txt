* Bug in computing the state

There is a case when the state of the file is computed incorectly: two views
share the same configspec which sets the file to branch at a label.  In the
first view, the file is checked out than checked in.  The branch will now be
created and the file will be at version 1 on that branch.  Since the second
view is not updated, the file is still at the old label.

vc-clearcase will compute the state of the file incorectly for the file in the
second view: the file will be considered up-to-date, but the actual state
should be 'need-update.  This is because vc-clearcase will consider a file
up-to-date of it is configspec rule has a "-mkbranch" directive.  It does not
check that there are versions on that branch.

For example:

configspec contains:

     element * .../branch1/LATEST
     element * LABEL1 -mkbranch branch1

File has the following versions:

     /main/3         -- LABEL1
     /main/branch1/1 -- branch1 is branched at /main/3

Snapshot view has the file at /main/3, that is the view is not up-to-date.
The status of the file should be 'needs-merge, but instead vc-clearcase
considers it 'up-to-date.
