This is the list of known bugs in vc-clearcase.el

* When trying to merge revisions (`vc-merge') on a file that is not
checked-out, vc asks for a checkout, but that the comment window pops
up, and vc-merge assumes the file was already checked out.  We need to
do an automatic checkout in this case, but how do we detect it?

* `vc-clearcase-merge' and `vc-clearcase-merge-news' can only succeed
They signal an error if the merge is not trivial.  clearcase merge has
no equivalent of the CVS conflict markers (that I know of).  Also, the
vc package can only resolve CVS style conflicts.

* vc-clearcase-checkout will run the vc-before-checkin-hook
This is because vc-clearcase-checkout will call vc-start-entry to get
the checkout message.  The functionality in vc-start-entry is not
trivial, and I don't want to reproduce it.  A possible solution is to
read the checkout mesage from the minibuffer.
