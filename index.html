<h1>vc-clearcase project homepage</h1>

This is the homepage for the vc-clearcase project, which provides
integration with ClearCase for GNU Emacs.  Please visit the
SourceForge.net homepage for the project
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vc-clearcase/">here</a>.



<h2>vc-clearcase.el</h2>

The package supports full VC functionality and also adds some
ClearCase specific functionality like updating static views, edit a
view's configspec, list checkouts and start the version tree browser
GUI on a file.  Once the package is loaded, these additional commands
will show up in the Tools/Version Control menu.

This version works with GNU Emacs 21 and the current CVS version and
has been tested with Clearcase on Windows XP and Solaris.


<h3>Highlights of the package:</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Version control operations are very responsive.  The package
  communicates with the cleartool process using a pipe and uses
  various caching techniques to improve responsiveness.

  <li> Label name completion is provided for vc-create-snapshot and
  vc-clearcase-label-diff-report.  This works quickly with large
  number of labels (more than 17076 of them at my site).

  <li> View-tag completion is provided for vc-clearcase-edcs (Edit
  Configspec).  Again, this works quickly with large numbers of views
  (more than 2600 at my site).

  <li> Being a back-end to vc.el, all packages that use vc.el work with
  ClearCase files (for example the ediff package and add-log).

  <li> The annotate mode allows navigating the versions of an
  annotated file and diff-ing these versions (vc.el from CVS GNU Emacs
  is required for this) in addition to the nice highlighting that
  vc.el provides.

  <li> The package provides an easy to use interface to cleartool (see
  the ah-cleartool/ah-cleartool-do functions).  This allows
  implementing complex operations on ClearCase files in Emacs-Lisp
  (see vc-clearcase-label-diff-report for an example).
</ul>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

This is the first public release of vc-clearcase.el.  I have used it
privately for more than a year without any problems, but I'm
interested in any feedback (good or bad) about it.  You can send me an
