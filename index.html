<h1>vc-clearcase project homepage</h1>

This is the homepage for the vc-clearcase project, which provides
integration with ClearCase for GNU Emacs.  Please visit the
SourceForge.net homepage for the project
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vc-clearcase/">here</a>.



<h2>vc-clearcase.el</h2>

<p>

The package supports full VC functionality and also adds some
ClearCase specific functionality like updating static views, edit a
view's configspec, list checkouts and start the version tree browser
GUI on a file.  Once the package is loaded, these additional commands
will show up in the Tools/Version Control menu.

<h3>Highlights of the package:</h3>

<ul>
  <li> Version control operations are very responsive.  The package
  communicates with the cleartool process using a pipe and uses
  various caching techniques to improve responsiveness.

  <li> Being a back-end to vc.el, all packages that use vc.el work with
  ClearCase files (for example the ediff package and add-log).

  <li> The annotate mode allows navigating the versions of an
  annotated file and diff-ing these versions (vc.el from CVS GNU Emacs
  is required for this) in addition to the nice highlighting that
  vc.el provides.

  <li> The package provides an easy to use interface to cleartool (see
  the ah-cleartool/ah-cleartool-do functions).  This allows
  implementing complex operations on ClearCase files in Emacs-Lisp
  (see vc-clearcase-label-diff-report for an example).
</ul>

<h3>Installation</h3>

The package comes in a single file, which you can
download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=160898">here</a>.

<ol>
  <li>Put this file in the site-lisp directory of your GNU Emacs
  installation and byte-compile it.

  <li> Open open vc-clearcase.el in Emacs, than execute the code
  below.  This will create a file named vc-clearcase-auto.el
  containing the autoloads for the file.

    <pre>
(with-current-buffer (get-buffer "vc-clearcase.el")
  (let* ((file (buffer-file-name (current-buffer)))
         (dir (file-name-directory file))
         (generated-autoload-file
          (expand-file-name "vc-clearcase-auto.el" dir)))
    (update-file-autoloads file)))
    </pre>

  <li> Add the following line to your ~/.emacs.el file:
    <pre>
(load "vc-clearcase-auto")
    </pre>
</ol>

If you don't want to generate autoloads, you will have to add the
symbol CLEARCASE (in uppercase) to `vc-handled-backends' via
customize, to tell the vc.el package about the new back end (the
autoloads above do that automatically for you.)
