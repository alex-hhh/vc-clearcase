Release 1.69

This is the first public release of vc-clearcase.el.  I have used it
privately for more than a year without any problems.  This version
works with GNU Emacs 21 and the current CVS version.  It has been
tested with Clearcase on Windows XP and Solaris.  See the
documentation section in vc-clearcase.el for installation
instructions.

HINT: The version number is 1.69 because this is the version of the
vc-clearcase.el in CVS.
