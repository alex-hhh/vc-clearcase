Release 1.82

The main improvement in this release is the ability to complete label
names for vc-create-snapshot and vc-clearcase-label-diff-report.  A
new vc-clearcase-start-view function is provided (bound to C-x v f),
plus some other minor updates.  See ChangeLog for more details.

Release 1.69

This is the first public release of vc-clearcase.el.  I have used it
privately for more than a year without any problems.  This version
works with GNU Emacs 21 and the current CVS version.  It has been
tested with Clearcase on Windows XP and Solaris.  See the
documentation section in vc-clearcase.el for installation
instructions.

HINT: The version number is 1.69 because this is the version of the
vc-clearcase.el in CVS.
