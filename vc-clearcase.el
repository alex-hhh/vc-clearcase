;;; Commentary:
;;
;; vc-clearcase.el is a ClearCase integration package that works as a
;; client to the Emacs VC package.  In addition to the standard VC
;; functionality, this package also allows you to update static views,
;; edit a view's configspec, list checkouts and start the version tree
;; browser GUI on a file.  Once the package is loaded, these
;; additional commands will show up in the Tools/Version Control menu.
;;

;;;; Documentation Notes

;;;;; Installation:
;;
;; NOTE: this version will not work with Emacs releases prior to version 23.
;;
;; 1/ Copy this directory under the site-lisp directory of your GNU/Emacs
;; installation.
;;
;; 2/ Byte compile vc-clearcase.el and ucm.el.  You can do it from inside
;; Emacs, or from the command line:
;;
;;   % emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile vc-clearcase.el
;;   % emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ucm.el
;;
;; 3/ Add the following line to your initialisation file (~/.emacs.el):
;;
;;   (load "vc-clearcase-auto")
;;

;;;; Cleartool transaction queue interface

;; ClearCase is slow.  Two techniques are used to improve the
;; responsiveness of Emacs when doing version-control operations.
;; First, cleartool is only started once (via a transaction queue),
;; and all VC commands use it for all the work.  Second, the VC
;; commands try to anticipate what information will be needed and ask
;; cleartool in advance for it.  By the time it is actually needed, it
;; will already be available, or at least the time to wait for it will
;; be shorter.  For example vc-clearcase-registered will also ask for
;; the files version (but does not wait for the answer), by the time
;; vc-clearcase-state-heuristic is called, the information will
;; hopefully be available.
;;
;; The 'user' functions from this section are `cleartool-ask' and
;; `cleartool-wait-for'.

;;;; Clearcase file properties

;; Rather than keeping all the version information as properties
;; accessible via vc-file-{get/set}prop, we define a structure to hold
;; all the information and store it in as the 'vc-clearcase-prop
;; property of a file.  We also define some pseudo structure members
;; in the form of functions starting with clearcase-fprop- -- they
;; return derived information from a fprop.

;; possible values for the STATUS slot:
;;
;; nil -- file is up-to-date
;;
;; 'reserved -- file is checked out reserved
;;
;; 'unreserved -- file is checked out unreserved
;;
;; 'hijacked -- file was modified without checking it out first
;;
;; 'missing -- file was removed from disk but not from ClearCase
;;
;; 'special-selection -- file version is not selected by a configspec rule.
;;     This can happen if the file is the result of a manual merge
;;
;; 'broken-view -- the view is in a broken state and version info cannot be
;;     retrieved.  This usually results from an aborted update -- running an
;;     update again should fix the problem.

(defun vc-clearcase-cancel-version (file editable)
  "Remove the current version of FILE.
FILE must be checked in and latest on its branch.  We use
\"rmver\" to remove the version, but a version will not be
removed when a branch begins there or it has labels or attributes
attached.

When EDITABLE is non nil, the file will be checked out and the
contents of the deleted version will be placed in FILE.  A
checkin at this point will create a new version with the same
contents as the deleted version.  This is useful if you checked
the file in by mistake and want to rework some changes.

When EDITABLE is nil, the version is removed completely.  The
current branch might be removed as well if
`clearcase-rmbranch-on-revert-flag' is non nil.

If an error is signalled during the cancel, the original version
is saved as a keep file in the same directory as FILE, so no data
is lost."

  ;; Implementation Notes:
  ;;
  ;; Here is what we need to do in order to cancel a version so that the
  ;; changes are kept ready for a new checkin:
  ;;
  ;; * make a temporary copy of the file and the checkin comment for the
  ;;   file.  Copy-file will create a read-only copy, since the file is
  ;;   checked in.
  ;;
  ;; * remove the version
  ;;
  ;; * on a snapshot view, this will leave the file in place as a view
  ;;   private file.  We need to remove the file and run a clearcase
  ;;   update to get the version controlled file back, otherwise
  ;;   ClearCase commands will not work on the file.
  ;;
  ;; * checkout the file.  We checkout the file unreserved, which we expect to
  ;;   succeed most of the time (unless you are in a UCM view and you don't
  ;;   have an activity set).  We will try to reserve the checkout, but do
  ;;   nothing if it fails.
  ;;
  ;; * we need to replace the checked out file with the saved copy, make
  ;;   the file writable and load it back into emacs.
  ;;
  ;;
  ;; To cancel a version so that it is completely removed we simply need
  ;; to:
  ;;
  ;; * remove the version
  ;;
  ;; * on a snapshot view, update the file
  ;;
  ;; * if removing the version left an empty branch, we honour the
  ;;   `clearcase-rmbranch-on-revert-flag' (remove the branch if the
  ;;   flag is set.
